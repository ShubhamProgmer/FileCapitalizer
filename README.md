# FileCapitalizer

Just a simple project I main while practicing os module,\
-> Used to capitalize the first letter of any file in a directory.\
-> You can provide or create a txt file of files not to touch.\
-> You can give any one extention to ignore all the files of that extention.\
\
If you want to use it, you can clone it by:
                           
    git clone https://github.com/ShubhamProgmer/FileCapitalizer
    
Thank You!
